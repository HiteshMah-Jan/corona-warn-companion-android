# How to install the app
There are 3 options:
### 1. Get the app from the Play Store
1. Download from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tosl.warnappcompanion
2. Write a short review
### 2. Install a release from GitHub
1. Download the latest released APK from the Assets at https://github.com/mh-/corona-warn-companion-android/releases
2. Install via `adb` tool and USB cable: `adb install corona-warn-companion-github-release.apk`
### 3. Build the app from source code, using Android Studio
1. `git clode https://github.com/mh-/corona-warn-companion-android.git`
2. In Android Studio, select a 'flavor': 
`github` is the normal version, called "Corona-Warn-Companion". 
`playstore` is a version that was renamed to "Warn-App-Companion" because of the Play Store requirements for COVID-19 apps;
this is not a _category 1 or 2_ app and must therefore not use COVID-19 related terms in its Play Store listing.
3. Build the `debug` build variant, and install it on your device. 
The `release` build variant will probably build out-of-the box only on macOS because of the way how the keystore for app signing is accessed.

# Features
This app helps you to better understand warnings of the official Corona-Warn-App.

**ATTENTION:** THE APP REQUIRES ROOT PERMISSIONS. Without root permissions, only a demo mode is possible that cannot access your risk encounters.

### What the app does:
1. The app reads the Rolling Proximity IDs recorded by your device from the Exposure Notifications database (this is only possible with root permissions, which is why the official Corona-Warn-App cannot display these details).

2. The app downloads the Diagnosis Keys from the official Corona-Warn-Server. It downloads the keys published daily for the last few days, and the keys published every hour for today. Therefore, different information than in the official Corona-Warn-App might be displayed.

3. The app compares both in order to find matches (risk encounters).

If risk encounters are found, it shows the details:
At which times and with which radio attenuation (roughly corresponds to the distance) did the encounters take place, and what level of transmission risk did the encounters have.

Note that 1 means a low and 8 means a high transmission risk.

### What the app does not do:
- The app does not process any personal data.
- The app only accesses the internet for the purpose 2 (see above), i.e. it only downloads data from the official Corona-Warn-Server and does not send any data to other servers.
- The app does not show any advertising.

**Note:** This app has only been tested on a few devices so far, so it is possible that it will not work and/or show incorrect results.

# Open Source
The source code of the app is published at https://github.com/mh-/corona-warn-companion-android, so you can check the source code, build the app yourself, and you are also welcome to contribute to improvements.

# Other
- The app is used for private purposes only, it is not used for any business purposes.
- The app is not a "hacking tool". It only reads data from the memory of your own device, which is stored there without additional encryption.
