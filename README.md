Android App Which Shows Details about CWA Exposures (Requires Root)

Note that the app can be compiled with [`DEMO_MODE = true`](https://github.com/mh-/corona-warn-companion-android/blob/0b44498f2cc1cbfb38d2e328eace07e4543fd4ff/app/src/main/java/org/tosl/coronawarncompanion/CWCApplication.java#L14) -
then it will show some pre-canned data, and the word "DEMO" at the top of the screen.
