<i>Corona-Warn-Companion</i> can (and does) work independently of the official CWA, but it needs input from something that collects Bluetooth RPIs. That can be…

* the official Corona app or F-Droid's <a href='https://f-droid.org/packages/de.corona.tracing/'>Corona Tracing</a> app using Google Mobile Services (root required to access its DB)
* the official Corona app or F-Droid's <a href='https://f-droid.org/packages/de.corona.tracing/'>Corona Tracing</a> app using microG (root required to access its DB)
* <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contextis.android.BLEScanner'>RaMBLE</a> (no root required)

<i>Corona-Warn-Companion</i> is intended to help you to better understand warnings of the Corona-Warn-Apps.

<b>ATTENTION: FOR FULL FUNCTIONALITY, THE APP REQUIRES ROOT PERMISSIONS.</b> Without root permissions, the app cannot access your risk encounters, and only three features are available: 1. Test how many diagnosis keys can be downloaded from the server; 2. Use RaMBLE data; 3. Demo Mode.

For CWA, ''Corona-Warn-Companion'' currently covers…

* Austria
* Germany
* Poland
* Switzerland
